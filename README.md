## Base

### Description

I made a quick sketch and extruded it.

[The Base in Onshape](https://cvilleschools.onshape.com/documents/66a36a2b54ae9e5074882f0e/w/8c90925c436178ae3cc82c05/e/f6c0483f0cedd2b4f5e7c527)

### Reflection

Creating this was very easy, but it took me longer because at first I didn't use the short cuts.

* sketching (shortcut **shift-s**)
* constructions lines (shortcut **Q**)
* dimensions (shortcut **D**)
* extruding both add and remove (shortcut key **E**)
* linear patterns (no shortcut)
