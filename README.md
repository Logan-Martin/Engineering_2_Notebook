## Base

### Description

I made a quick sketch and extruded it.

### Evidence
[The Base in Onshape](https://cvilleschools.onshape.com/documents/66a36a2b54ae9e5074882f0e/w/8c90925c436178ae3cc82c05/e/f6c0483f0cedd2b4f5e7c527)

### Reflection 
Creating this was very easy, but it took me longer because at first I didn't use the short cuts.

* sketching (shortcut **shift-s**)
* constructions lines (shortcut **Q**)
* dimensions (shortcut **D**)
* extruding both add and remove (shortcut key **E**)
* linear patterns (no shortcut)


## Mount

### Description
Added a new sketch ontop of the base and extruded it.

### Evidence

### Reflection
This part was also easy, although I did have to go back and redo some things.

## Fork

### Description
Supprizingly you can't eat with it despite it's name.
I made a circle, extruded it and made filleted corners and made a tube.

### Evidence
[The fork is a seperate part, but it is here](https://cvilleschools.onshape.com/documents/66a36a2b54ae9e5074882f0e/w/8c90925c436178ae3cc82c05/e/f6c0483f0cedd2b4f5e7c527)

### Reflection
i was very confused when making the first extrude, but then I finished it. Making a chamfer doesn't look like it made a huge difference.

## Tire

### Description
I made a trapezoid and revolved it to make a tire.

### Evidence
[The Tire is a seperate part, but it is here](https://cvilleschools.onshape.com/documents/66a36a2b54ae9e5074882f0e/w/8c90925c436178ae3cc82c05/e/f6c0483f0cedd2b4f5e7c527)

### Reflection
Make sure you have the correct measurements, it might break something later.

## Wheel

### Description
Made a few boxes, made a revole, added holes, and lastly filleted a lot of edges.
### Evidence
[The wheel is in a part file, but it is here](https://cvilleschools.onshape.com/documents/66a36a2b54ae9e5074882f0e/w/8c90925c436178ae3cc82c05/e/f6c0483f0cedd2b4f5e7c527)

### Refletion 
the hardest part for me was dementioning the wrong thing.

## AxleCollarBearings

### Description
I Made a bunch of circles and extruded them, then took out a  chip of it on each side. Then I sketched a bigger circle off of the axle and made an extrude which made the collar. Finaly I remade the collar on a seperate document, but bigger to make the washer.
### Evidence

### Reflection
I'm getting a lot faster at making these. Although it is fun, I still make mistakes. When making this there was no tricky part.
